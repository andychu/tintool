Tree Tools
----------

Formerly 'tin'.

Tools that operate on trees of file.

A "treespec" is a mapping of files from one place to another.

- py-deps
  - Takes a python file as input, set PYTHONPATH, and then creates a treespec.

- create
  - Take treespec as input.  Create archive file with output.
  - TODO:
    - rename to "pack" or something.
    - should still retain the option to make the output executable?

- multi
  - cp
  - mv
  - ln
  - Take tree as input


The Basis package manager uses archive files and thus trees.  Should basis be
in here?  Most of these tools are probably used for packages.

Later this will evolve into using CONTENT space.  Right now it is just PATH
space.

Other Basis tools:
- Tool to generate shell script stubs?  Or just a text file for now.  It can be
  the same for everyone.

Other Tree Tools
----------------

- Checksum tool
  - For embedding in Basis packages
  - For checking that they're installed correctly

- Filter to make things read-only?

- Pack / Unpack tool

- Eventually: Tool for differential transfer of content, like Git.

- Transform content <-> path space?


Treespec
--------

Can't contain spaces in filenames.

Right now I have this 'x' thing -- not sure I want that.

multi
-----

Data-driven tool for batch copying, moving, and symlinking of files .

py-deps
-------

Use the Python interpreter to crawl dependencies.  

Set PYTHONPATH.


////
TODO:

sh-deps

Parse lines like:

source $(resolve $SOURCE_PATH foo/bar/baz.sh)

resolve is a tool that parses the first argument?

source $(resolve foo/bar/path)

source already respects $PATH.  I think that is sort of confusing and
overloaded.

I guess you could do PATH=$PATH:foo/bar sh-deps

- Should this repo be called something else?  Don't make it tin-centric.
